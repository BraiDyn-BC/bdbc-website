## Abstract

## Result

### Task

The objective of this task is to learn the action of holding the lever continuously within a set target zone for a fixed time (T_target) (A). The task is in the form of a spontaneously initiated task. The task progresses as follows by transitioning between task states (B).

![繧ｹ繧ｯ繝ｪ繝ｼ繝ｳ繧ｷ繝ｧ繝繝 2022-08-24 3.05.33.png](2022-08-24_3.05.33.png)

The task state transitions from "ITI" to "Ready" by holding the lever below the base threshold set at 0.5 mm for at least 1 second. If the lever exceeds the basal threshold during the "Ready" period, the Task state moves to "Go" and the trial begins, giving the mouse a reaction period of 1000 ms. During this period, if the lever is continuously in the target zone for T_target (200 ms), the trial is considered successful and a reward (4 ﾂｵl of water) is given immediately even during the reaction period, and the Task state moves to "Success". On the other hand, if the task is not successful within the reaction period, the task state will be changed to "Failure". The target zone is adaptive from the start of the session to the success of the session. The range decreases according to the formula ﾂｱ3k^n (k=0.995; n=number of successes). To maintain individual motivation, the range was set to increase with the time of the last success (T_lr[sec]) according to the formula T_lr0.004. To provide sensory feedback to the individual on the extent of the target zone, a 10 kHz pure tone was presented while the lever was within the target zone during the "Go" period.

#### Learning process of Task

The learning of the task generally progressed as follows (the data below are different from the individuals in the sample data, and the Target zone was set to start at 5 ﾂｱ 3 mm). Training was initiated after 2 days of water withdrawal restriction (Terada et al., Nat. Commun., 2018). (A) shows the evolution of Target zones within each session from Session 1 to 6 in one individual; as the sessions progressed, learning progressed to succeed in narrower target zones, and the number of successes increased accordingly (B). (C) shows the average trajectory of the lever at Session 6, with the "go" period transition point as 0, for the width of the target zone indicated at the top of each figure. As the learning progresses, the lever trajectory moves around the center of the target zone regardless of the range of the target zone.

#### Imaging

One- or two-photon imaging was performed in mice that had completed after 6 session of the tasks. Mice were Thy1-jRGECO1a transgenic mice, and individuals undergoing one-photon imaging were treated with skull transparency enhancement followed by wide-area one-photon calcium imaging of the dorsal cerebral cortex using macrofluorescence microscopy (Kondo et al, Cell. Rep., 2021) was performed. For individuals undergoing two-photon imaging, two-photon calcium imaging (Terada et al., Nat. Commun., 2018) was performed after installation of a glass window.

## Method

### Setting of Face and Body cameras

The Body and Face cameras were positioned so that the position from the head fixing plate to the imaging surface was approximately [Body] X=6, Y=165, Z=-120 (mm) and [Face] X=40, Y=102, Z=-40 (mm) when X, Y, and Z are the front-back, left-right, and top-bottom positions from the mouse, respectively. The resolution of each camera is approximately The resolution of each camera is approximately 0.186 mm/pix for [Body] and 0.105 mm/pix for [Face]. The cameras were positioned as defined by the following 3D model.

### Processing of Face and Body camera image

DeepLabCut was used to track markers in the following areas. For more information, see Data desciription.

![tracking points.png](tracking_points.png)

### Processing of 2p image data

The analysis was performed using MATLAB (2020a; Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). Lateral displacements of the acquired image sequences were corrected using the NoRMCorre algorithm (Pnevmatikakis and Giovannucci, 2017). The image after the aforementioned processing is treated as I_raw below. After motion correction, the region of interest (ROI) was determined using the CNMF algorithm (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016). This algorithm decomposes I_raw into the temporal component of neural activity, its spatial component (ROI), and the background (I_back). After identifying these components, the background signal-removed luminance (F_bcsub) of each ROI was determined by multiplying the estimated spatial components in the background-subtracted raw image (Iraw - Iback). The detrended trend luminance change (ﾎ認/F; F_dff) was then calculated with the 8th percentile value at each time point ﾂｱ30 seconds as F0. The ﾎ認/F for each ROI was estimated by individually estimating the decay time constant using the constrained AR-2 OASIS algorithm (Friedrich et al., PLoS Comput. Biol., 2017) and deconvolving the estimated values (F_dcv,F_dff). dcv,F_denoise) were obtained.
