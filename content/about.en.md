## Introduction

Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A), "[Deciphering and Manipulating Brain Dynamics for Emergence of Behaviour Change in Multidimensional Biology](https://braidyn-bc.jp/)" we will create "Behavioral Change Biology (BraiDyn-BC)" to elucidate behavioral change, which leads organisms to spontaneously perform new behaviors. The BraiDyn-BC Database will promote the utilization of high-quality brain activity and behavioral data acquired mainly by the research team and make the data publicly available in order to increase the number of researchers who participate in behavioral change biology.

In the case of data that have not been published, **Sample dataset** of one session per individual will be made available to the public. The use of the **Complete dataset** will be based on collaborative research with the laboratory of the data source. The use of the sample dataset allows researchers to freely experiment with the analysis based on Creative Commons and other licenses.

Current data and analysis methods are not standardized, but this will be addressed in future updates.

## Data License

Licensing and terms of use of the data are described on the respective pages.

## Ethics Statement

Unless otherwise noted, animal experiments are conducted with the approval of the Committee on Animal Experimentation, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo. Research using genetically modified mice of various Cre strains is conducted with the approval of the Committee on Genetically Modified Organisms, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo.
