  Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A), "<a href="https://braidyn-bc.jp/">Deciphering and Manipulating Brain Dynamics for Emergence of Behaviour Change in Multidimensional Biology</a>" we will create "Behavioral Change Biology (BraiDyn-BC)" to elucidate behavioral change, which leads organisms to spontaneously perform new behaviors. The BraiDyn-BC Database will promote the utilization of high-quality brain activity and behavioral data acquired mainly by the research team and make the data publicly available in order to increase the number of researchers who participate in behavioral change biology. In the case of data that have not been published, <b>Sample dataset</b> of one session per individual will be made available to the public. The use of the <b>Complete dataset</b> will be based on collaborative research with the laboratory of the data source. The use of the sample dataset allows researchers to freely experiment with the analysis based on Creative Commons and other licenses. Current data and analysis methods are not standardized, but this will be addressed in future updates.
